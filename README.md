# Music-Recommendation-System
This project is a Music Recommendation System built using Machine Learning and deployed with Streamlit. It uses Collaborative Filtering with the SVD algorithm from the Surprise library to recommend music based on user preferences. The system suggests songs based on the similarity of users' listening habits and ratings.
